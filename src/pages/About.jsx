  I’m Talia, a Business Analytics undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, graduating in August 2026, with a strong interest in translating data into clear, actionable insights. 
  I have hands-on experience building analytical dashboards and introducing automation into work processes across sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, and government services.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside analytics, I have a strong interest in media and design, which has led me to pursue experiences that combine creative thinking with data-driven decision-making. 
  At the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, I designed an exploratory dashboard to creatively present insights from Singapore's performance in the Global Innovation Index.
  Effective analytics should ensure that insights are intuitive, accessible, and meaningful to the people they serve.

        Curious about how technology drives both efficiency and sustainability across industries, my time at Siemens as a 
        Strategy Intern deepened my appreciation for the practical applications of digitalisation and artificial intelligence 
        in manufacturing, while strengthening my understanding of sales metrics, processes and CRM systems.

        Looking ahead, my upcoming internship at Synapxe combines my interests in analytics, design, 
        and human impact. Working on the Value-Driven Care initiative under the Ministry of Health, I will be engaging with data 
        that directly reflects healthcare outcomes —reinforcing the importance of understanding data context and designing 
        insights that support informed, human-centred decision-making.

      <p>
  I am seeking analytics, strategy, or product-related roles where data can be used to drive informed decision-making 
  and measurable impact.
